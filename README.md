# othello
othello game made using java swing

make sure that you have images for the circles, this is the naming convention I used

public static ImageIcon OPEN = new ImageIcon("src/images/blank.png");
public static ImageIcon BLACK = new ImageIcon("src/images/blackdisc.png");
public static ImageIcon WHITE = new ImageIcon("src/images/whitedisc.png");
public static ImageIcon LEGAL = new ImageIcon("src/images/legalmarker.png");

There may be bugs present in the code, I have lost the copy of the code which resolved every issue
